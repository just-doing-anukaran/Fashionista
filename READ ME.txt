Hey!

This is a design and front end side of a hypothetical e-commerce website named:
Fashionista.

The theme of this website are the exotic birds that are unique and fashionable 
and rare, that stand out in this banal world. This could be easily explained by the vector images of birds that I have created using Adobe Illustrator. 

To give the landing page a dynamic look, I have created three product slideshow 
videos using Adobe After Effects with vibrant color gradings.

The design's beauty is at its zenith on 1920 by 1080 resolution. 

Thank you.
Anukar.
